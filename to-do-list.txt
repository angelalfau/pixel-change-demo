### TODO:
#
# retake images using iron and whiteHot
# think safe to take normal op as heavy and heavy op as faulty for testing purposes
# put line thru flir logo
# offset and rotation simultaneuosly
# maybe another registration algorithm that uses feature matching
#
# tweak params of registration
# breakpoints on registration
# smaller rotations for registration
# use heavy as reference
# take new pics with higher scales (low++ high++) do multiple scales for each
# manually create hot spots, changing luminance in 4x4 6x6 etc. keep changing
# When can we see difference? how much temp diff is +10 luminance, do several steps
# goal is to see difference in 1 pixel with 1 luminance change
#
# if retaking image, remember offset and possibly rotation degree
# and note offset/rotation in filename
# 1. how much offset can be corrected
# 2. how much rotation can be corrected
# 3. need absolute value or not of the difference?
# 4. how to crop equalized image
